# GymTrack PWA Application Overview

## Core Application Purpose

GymTrack PWA is a Progressive Web Application for tracking weightlifting workouts with prioritization on:
- Simplicity and ease of use during active workouts
- Fast user interactions with minimal steps
- Full offline functionality
- Cross-device compatibility

## Technology Stack Requirements

- React with TypeScript for component development
- Material UI for consistent UI components
- IndexedDB for client-side storage
- Service Worker for offline capability
- Web App Manifest for installability

## Development Principles

Always adhere to these core principles:

- **Mobile-First**: Design all interfaces for mobile first, then adapt for larger screens
- **Offline-First**: All core functionality must work without network connectivity
- **Performance-Focused**: Optimize for speed on lower-end mobile devices
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for complete type safety throughout the codebase
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works in all browsers, enhanced features in modern ones

## Key Features

The application must implement these core features:

- Exercise management (built-in and custom exercises)
- Workout program management (templates and routines)
- Active workout logging with flexibility to deviate from planned workouts
- Workout history and statistics
- Data export capability
- Full offline support

## User Experience Priorities

When implementing any feature, prioritize these UX considerations:

1. Fast workout logging with minimal taps
2. Large, easily tappable controls during workouts
3. Ability to quickly adjust weights and reps
4. Clear visual indicators for logged sets
5. Straightforward navigation between exercises

Always optimize for the core use case: quickly logging workout sets while actively exercising.
