# Test Error Fix Plan

## Current Issues
10 failing tests across three files:
- `useWorkout.test.ts` (5 failures): State management issues
- `WorkoutScreenReset.test.tsx` (3 failures): UI elements not found in DOM
- `WorkoutScreen.test.tsx` (2 failures): Button elements not found

## Plan to Fix

1. **Analyze `useWorkout` hook implementation**
   - Examine state initialization and management
   - Check exercise navigation functions
   - Verify set logging and deletion functionality

2. **Fix state management issues in `useWorkout`**
   - Ensure proper initialization of workout state
   - Fix array handling for exercises and sets
   - Correct navigation between exercises

3. **Address component rendering issues**
   - Set up proper test providers/context in test files
   - Verify component mounting in test environment
   - Fix conditional rendering that might be preventing elements from appearing

4. **Update test expectations if needed**
   - Align test assertions with actual component behavior
   - Update expected values if implementation has changed

5. **Implement incremental fixes**
   - Fix `useWorkout` hook first (most failures)
   - Then address `WorkoutScreenReset.test.tsx`
   - Finally fix `WorkoutScreen.test.tsx`

6. **Verify fixes with continuous testing**
   - Run affected tests after each fix
   - Run full test suite at the end
